- üì¢ Hello, I am an ordinary C++ programmer who is currently involved in software and game reverse engineering, as well as anti-reverse engineering. I also work on single-chip microcontroller/embedded development and writing virtual machine protection shells for software on Windows similar to VMP.

- üì¢ I started getting involved in software development and cracking since 2019, mostly focusing on game-related software. My knowledge is more centered around how to prevent cracking. Due to my extensive experience in game development, I have a good understanding of C/C++ and even assembly programming. Additionally, I have decent knowledge and experience in C# due to my exposure to Unity game development. While my experience in Linux and web development is not particularly outstanding, I do possess a basic foundation in those areas.

- üì¢ Currently, I am still learning in the fields of reverse engineering, anti-reverse engineering, and exploring other areas of development as well.
